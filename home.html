            <h3>I Create, Innovate, and Develop!</h3>
            <p>
                I took up BSComSci, I got bored in class so I dropped out and decided to work instead.<br />
                While working for several companies, I keep honing my skills through self-study, tutorial videos, online courses, and boot camps.<br />
                So I worked as an IT staff, as a Graphic Designer, as a Database administrator, as a Developer, and as a Service Desk Supervisor.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>You may think it's hard, but I did it!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I never stop upskilling<br />
                and as a matter of fact,<br />
                I have an ongoing / am currently enrolled in a <u>Development Bootcamp.</u>
